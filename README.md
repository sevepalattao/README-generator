## README-generator

# Description

For this challenge it was my job to add to existing starter code to develop a README generator. The technologies I used for this were Node and JavaScript. The generating process is started by running the command ```bash node index.js ``` in the command line terminal. It then asks you a series of relevant questions for a readme file. Once the questions are completed, a readme file is generated.

Below is a screenshot of a sample README file created using this generator.
